# PracticalMachineLearning
Class Assignment for Practical Machine Learning based on the Dumbbell Exercise dataset.

# Background

Using devices such as _Jawbone Up_, _Nike FuelBand_, and _Fitbit_ it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how _much_ of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how _well they do it_. 

# Goal

In this project, we will be using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). We will analyze trends and set up classifiers to predict which version of the activity was performed. Model selection will be discussed and error rates will be given, along with a final model applied to the testing set.

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.
